E-Commerce Microservices
This project is a microservices-based system for managing a simple e-commerce application. It consists of services for user authentication, product management, and order processing. The system emphasizes concurrency control and high availability through clustering.

Microservices Architecture
The system is structured into the following microservices:

User Authentication Service: Handles user registration and login.
Product Management Service: Manages product information, including creation and retrieval.
Order Processing Service: Manages order creation and retrieval.
Technology Stack
The microservices are built using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+. The data persistence layer uses SQLAlchemy for database interactions, and SQLite is used as the database for simplicity. Passlib is used for password hashing, and Pydantic is used for data validation.

Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Install dependencies:

Run the FastAPI application:

Endpoints
User Authentication Service:

POST /register: Register a new user.
POST /login: Authenticate user login.
Product Management Service:

POST /products: Create a new product.
GET /products/{product_id}: Retrieve product details by ID.
Order Processing Service:

Endpoints not implemented yet.
Additional Notes
Concurrency control and clustering mechanisms are not implemented in this basic version.
For production use, consider replacing SQLite with a more robust database like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
Error handling and logging should be further enhanced for production-grade applications.
Unit tests should be written to ensure the correctness of critical components.
